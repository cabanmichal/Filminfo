### Filminfo

Simple gui to add basic metadata to film scans.

-   You can store Film, Camera and Lens information and later reuse them.
-   Also allows to view and remove metadata from images.
-   Tested only on macOS (might work elsewhere).
-   Very few dependencies.
-   It uses [ExifTool](https://exiftool.org) to do the real work. It must be installed separately.
